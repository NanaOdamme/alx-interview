Sure, here's an example README.md file that you can use to describe the `canUnlockAll` function:

---

# canUnlockAll Function

The `canUnlockAll` function is designed to determine if all boxes in a given list can be opened, assuming each box contains keys to other boxes. This function utilizes an iterative approach to explore the boxes and their keys.

## Function Description

The `canUnlockAll` function takes a single argument:

- `boxes`: A list containing all boxes with their respective keys. Each box is represented as a list of integers, where each integer represents a key that can unlock another box.

The function returns a boolean value:

- `True` if all boxes can be opened.
- `False` if there are boxes that cannot be opened.

## Usage

To use the `canUnlockAll` function, import it into your Python script or interactive session. Call the function with a list of boxes as the argument to determine if all boxes can be unlocked.

Example usage:

```python
from lockbox_solver import canUnlockAll

boxes1 = [[1], [2], [3], []]  # All boxes can be opened
boxes2 = [[1, 2], [3], [4], []]  # Not all boxes can be opened

print(canUnlockAll(boxes1))  # Output: True
print(canUnlockAll(boxes2))  # Output: False
```

## Algorithm

1. Initialize a set to keep track of visited boxes (`visited`).
2. Initialize a list to keep track of boxes to be explored (`to_explore`), starting with box 0.
3. While there are boxes to explore (`to_explore` is not empty):
   - Pop the next box from `to_explore`.
   - Mark the current box as visited.
   - Add unvisited boxes to `to_explore` if they have keys to other boxes.
4. Return `True` if the number of visited boxes is equal to the total number of boxes, indicating all boxes can be opened. Otherwise, return `False`.

## Note

- This function assumes valid input data where boxes are represented as lists of integers and keys are positive integers.
- If the input `boxes` list is empty, the function returns `False` by default.
